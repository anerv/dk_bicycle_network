- If speed max 50 AND max lanes 2 --> LTS 1 **OK**
- If speed max 50 AND max lanes 4 --> LTS 2 (if more than four, lts 4) **OK**
- If speed max 60 --> LTS 3 **OK**
- If speed max 70 --> LTS 4

## No bike infra/class 3

- If speed max 30 --> LTS 1 (Was actually 40 - how to argue for 30??) **OK**

- If residential street AND speed more than 30 max 50 --> LTS 2 **OK**

- If non-residential and speed more than 30 max 50 --> LTS 3 **OK**

- If speed more than 50 -- LTS 4

- If 4 lanes or more, regardless of speed --> LTS 3 **OK**

## LTS 1

- if protected bike infra
- if speed max 50 and unprotected bike infra
- If speed max 30

## LTS 2

- if residential street and no bike infra and speed max 50
- if unprotected bike infra 

## LTS 3

## LTS 4

25 miles = 40 km
30 miles = 50 km
35 = 56 (60)
40 miles = 70 (64)

look into those with 1, 3, and 4:
ROADS WITH MANY LANES ASSUMED ENDS UP GETTING LTS 4 DESPITE VERY LOW MAX SPEED

1,2:
issue with lanes - i think it is fixed

1,3:
roads with speed 20 but 4 lanes

1,999:
pedestrian etc with low speed but no cycling - fix

2,3:
no bike infra,
speed 50
lanes 4
